# AI-Powered-Contract-Analysis-Using-LLMs
🔍This project builds a document processing pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract key legal clauses (e.g. termination, confidentiality, liability) and generate concise summaries from contracts in the CUAD dataset. It demonstrates practical applications of LLMs for legal document understanding, extraction, and summarization.
